##Accounts module

the accounts module checks if accounts are correctly configured on the machine.


## Accounts tests description

### tests performed on /etc/passwd file

the following tests are performed :

- LIN_GEN_ACC_02 : root login
it is considered a better practice to not allow login as root user, and to use "sudo" instead, which is temporary "root-like". In this meaning, it tights the window for a full privileged exploitation.

if the shell of root user is defined as "/sbin/nologin", then root login is disabled. Otherwise, the test should emits a warning.

- LIN_GEN_ACC_03 : non root uid 0
the uid is a 15bits long positive integer that identifies a user on the linux system. Especially, a user with uid "0" has full root privileges. In this meaning, no user but the root account should have a uid set to 0.

the test checks so if a non-root account has uid 0, which should be avoided.

- LIN_GEN_ACC_01: password in shadow
on unix systems, the password is now saved within the /etc/shadow file, which has restricted permissions, not like /etc/passwd which is accessible by everyone. Especially, if the password field of an account in /etc/passwd file is set to "x", this means the password is defined in shadow file. Otherwise, if it's blank, no password is asked for login as the associated user ; and if a cryptographic hash is used, then every process can access that hash, in order for example to crack it offline after.

the tests checks so if every account has a shadowed password.

- LIN_GEN_ACC_04 : multiple users with same uid
on unix systems, the uid is the identifier of a user for the OS. In this sense, if multiple users have the same uid, then those users have same rights, which can lead to some unwanted actions.
the test so checks if there is multiple users with same uid.

## tests performed on /etc/shadow file:
- LIN_GEN_ACC_05 : expiration date for password
